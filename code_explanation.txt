Redis Server Code Explanation - Restaurant Analogy

This Redis server code works like a smart restaurant:

**The Restaurant (Server)**
- Opens on "127.0.0.1:6379" (like a restaurant address)
- Waits for customers (clients) to walk in

**When Customers Arrive**
- Each customer gets their own waiter (thread) 
- The waiter stays with that customer the entire time
- Multiple customers can be served simultaneously

**How Waiters Understand Orders (Redis Protocol Parser)**
The waiters now have a special training to understand customer orders! They can decode the restaurant's special ordering format:
- Customers don't just say "PING" - they speak in a structured way: `*2\r\n$4\r\nECHO\r\n$3\r\nhey\r\n`
- The waiter (parser) breaks this down:
  - `*2` = "This order has 2 parts"
  - `$4\r\nECHO` = "First part is 4 letters: ECHO"
  - `$3\r\nhey` = "Second part is 3 letters: hey"
- So the waiter understands: "Customer wants ECHO with argument 'hey'"

**What Each Waiter Does Now**
1. Listens to what the customer says (reads data)
2. **NEW**: Decodes the special restaurant language (Redis protocol)
3. **NEW**: Checks what the customer actually ordered:
   - If they say "PING" → responds "PONG" (simple string: `+PONG\r\n`)
   - If they say "ECHO [something]" → repeats back exactly what they said (bulk string: `$3\r\nhey\r\n`)
   - If they say something else → defaults to "PONG"
4. Keeps doing this until the customer leaves
5. If something goes wrong, the waiter stops serving that customer

**Key Benefits**
- Multiple customers can be served at once (concurrent connections)
- One slow customer doesn't block others
- Each conversation is independent
- **NEW**: Waiters can understand different types of orders!
- **NEW**: Responses are properly formatted in the restaurant's language

The restaurant is now much smarter - it can handle different orders and respond appropriately!

}
```

**Key Insights:**
1. **Each `thread::spawn` creates a new waiter** who can work independently, so the restaurant can serve many customers simultaneously instead of one at a time!

2. **The `parse_redis_command` function is like waiter training** - it teaches waiters how to decode the restaurant's special ordering language (Redis RESP protocol).

3. **The restaurant now has a proper menu system** - different orders (`PING`, `ECHO`) get different responses, making it much more useful than just saying "PONG" to everything!

4. **Smart fallback system** - if a waiter can't understand an order, they default to the simple "PONG" response rather than breaking.
